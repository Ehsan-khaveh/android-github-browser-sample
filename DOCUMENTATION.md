# Documentation

This README file includes some details about the way I approached the assignment. It's my hope that it clarifies my thought process while solving the problem at hand and communicates some of the decisions and assumptions I made along the way.

## Approach

Below is a high-level step-by-step plan for approaching the assignment:

### Step 0 - Get started
- [x] Create this document

### Step 1 - Preparation
- [x] Fork of the repository
- [x] Run the code and see the features in action
- [x] Get familiar with the code
- [x] Read the tasks thoroughly and ask for clarifications if needed
- [ ] Make a plan for how you want to approach every task - include an estimate for time-boxing. Include testing and documentation in the plan and the estimate

### Step 2 - Complete the main tasks
- [ ] Complete the main tasks one by one based on the priority. Write tests and document decisions and assumptions as you go.
    - [ ] Task 1 - Navigation Framework Refactoring
    - [ ] Task 2 - Implement a Fake GithubService and ViewModel unit tests
    - [ ] Task 3 - Add a feature: User Details
- [ ] Ensure all the requirements in the description are fulfilled before moving on to the bonus points

### Step 3 - Tackle the bonus tasks
- [ ] If the time permits tackle the bonus tasks. Otherwise write some documentation explaining how you would have approached them

### Step 4 - Finalise & submit
- [ ] Read the description again and make sure you have completed all the tasks
- [ ] Create a PR
